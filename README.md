# AI Cube Solver

## Features
- Solves 2x2 Rubik's Cube using various AI algorithms:
  - Breadth-First Search (BFS)
  - Better BFS with limited moves
  - A* Search
  - Iterative Deepening A* (IDA*)
  - MiniMax algorithm
- Implements two heuristics for guiding the AI:
  - Simple heuristic
  - Manhattan Distance heuristic
- Provides a Graphical User Interface (GUI) for interactive cube solving:
  - Generates random cube configurations, with users able to specify the number of scrambles for testing
  - Displays 2D and 3D representations of the Rubik's Cube
  - Allows users to perform moves and observe the cube state
  - Facilitates easy experimentation with solving strategies
